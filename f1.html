   <h2>Spider Man No Way Home</h2><br>
   <p>
    After Quentin Beck posthumously frames Peter Parker for murder and reveals his identity as Spider-Man, Parker, his girlfriend MJ, best friend Ned Leeds, and his aunt May are interrogated by the Damage Control Department. Parker's charges were dropped thanks to attorney Matt Murdock, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Parker, M Jay, and Ned's requests are denied, Parker goes to Sanctuary to seek help from Stephen Strange, who proposes a spell that will make people forget Parker's identity as Spider-Man. Parker repeatedly requests modifications to allow his loved ones to keep their memories, which spoils the spell, but Strange contains it and causes Parker to leave.
    Parker goes to persuade an MIT official to reconsider MJ and Ned's requests, but is suddenly attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius ​​tears Parker's nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit, which attaches to his mechanical claws and allows Parker to disable them. When Norman Osborne arrives and attacks, Strange moves Parker to Sanctorum and puts Octavius ​​into a dungeon. Strang explains that the Corrupt Spell summoned people from other universes who know the identity of Spider-Man, and orders Parker, M-Jay, and Ned to find and capture them. 
    As Parker captures Max Dillion and Flint Marco, Osborne regains control of himself from his split personality in the Green Ghouls. He goes to the Fist Building, where he rests before Parker retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spiderman, Osborne, Octavius, and Dellion realize that they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strang is a spell that will return the villains to their own universe, but Parker argues that they must first heal the forces of the bad guys and madness to prevent their deaths upon their return. Parker steals the packaged amulet, locks Strange in the mirror dimension, and, with May, takes the bad guys to Happy Hogan's apartment. He successfully cures Octavius, but Osborne's Goblin character takes over and convinces unsuspecting villains to betray Parker. As Dillon, Marco and Connors escape, Osborne hits May, who tells Parker that "with great force, there must be great responsibility" before she dies.  
    Ned discovers that he can create portals using the Strang ring, which he and Am Jay use to try to locate Peter. Instead, they find two other versions of Parker and are also summoned by a Strang spell, nicknamed "Peter 2" from the world of Osborne, Octavius ​​and Marco (Tobey Maguire) and "Peter 3" from the world of Connors and Dellion (Andrew Garfield). Ned and M Jay Parker finds and comforts him while other Parkers share stories of losing loved ones; They encourage Parker to fight in May's honor. 
    Each of the three Parker develops cures for the remaining villains and tempts Dillon, Marco, and Connors with the Statue of Liberty, with Peter To and Parker curing Marco and Connors, respectively, while Octavius ​​arrives to help and cure Dillon. He frees Ned Strange from the dimension of the mirror, but Osborne arrives and destroys the bound spell, ripping apart the barrier separating the universes. While Strang works to maintain the barrier, an angry Parker attempts to kill Osborne, but is stopped by Peter II. Peter 3 and Parker injected Osborne into his treatment, and he regained his sanity. Parker realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase himself from everyone's memory and asks Strange to do so, while MJ and Ned promises he will find them again. The spell is cast, and everyone returns to their own world - including Eddie Brock, who left behind a piece of Venom's body. Two weeks later, Parker visited MJ and Ned to reintroduce himself, but decided not to.
